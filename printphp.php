<?php print("For my website I chose to use Yahoo Small Business Web Hosting (Yahoo). I first looked at Yahoo because Professor Hart suggested it and because it met all the requirements for the class, which included supporting PHP and mySQL5.x. After looking into it further, I found there to be other beneficial aspects. One of the major pros is the price. It is only $10 a month, which is reasonably priced. For smaller, low-traffic sites like the ones we will be creating, it is fairly fast."); ?> 
<?php print("If I were using Yahoo for a website that was much larger or more complex than the ones we are creating for this class, I would definitely run into some problems. For starters, they donâ€™t provide access to .htaccess files. It is shared hosting, which means that if you have a very heavy imaged site or have more than 4K-5K visitors in a day, it can run very slowly. It is also been reported from many different review sites that the customer service is very difficult to get a hold of and work with.");?>
